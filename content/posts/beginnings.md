Every story needs a beginning and this post is the start of my brand new blog.<!--more-->

This is the “Hello World” of this site.

I’ve written a lot of content in my life, but I’m ashamed to say I’ve never had my own blog. Until now.

I like a lot of different things. Food. Theology. Technology. Travel.

So I plan to blog about all of these things and more and I hope it’s interesting enough for you to come back for more.

Cheers.
